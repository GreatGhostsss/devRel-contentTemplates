Hands-on tutorials provide a step-by-step guide to build or deploy a specific service or solution (based on coding languages, framework, or use case). This can/will often include code samples, GIFs, brief videos catalyzing the user's learning process. This kind of information-rich and robust media can really buoy the user's learning process.
