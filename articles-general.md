What's to say about the format of an article? It's the string quartet of the content/literary world—its difficulty lies in how bare it is. For DevRel, we don't want to reinvent this deliverable. One nice example from another Oracle colleague can be found on Medium here. It's quite technical, but the visualizations help soften how intimidating the whole thing seems. Anyways, the odds are that your article will need to be organized in sections. Let's acheive that organization with headers. Again, nothing crazy here, just—

# Title

First paragraph

More content

## First header

More content. 

### Second header

Additional content which is substantively different from the content in the first section.
